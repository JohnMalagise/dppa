## Analyzing the Differences

I took the top 25 OPS leaders of 2020 and calculated their DPPA. As shown by OPS ranking, the order is significantly different when you order it via DPPA, even though the two statistics don't seem to be much different from one another. 

## Juan Soto
Juan Soto rakes.

## DJ LeMahieu

DJ Lemahieu is ranked 4th according to OPS but is 17th according to DPPA. He drops so far down because he never attempts to steal bases, and because DPPA is calculated off of plate appearances instead of at-bats. Because of this, LeMahieu appears to be less productive per plate appearance than someone who can hit for extra bases as well as steal bases.

## Fernando Tatis Jr.

Tatis makes a huge jump when comparing his OPS ranking to his DPPA ranking. The young superstar makes such a high jump because, in addition to his many extra-base hits and a high amount of walks, he steals bases. In the shortened 2020 season, he stole 11 bases (the most on this list) and was only thrown out 3 times. Thinking mathematically the 11 stolen bases he had can be thought of as 11 singles that he turned into doubles. 

# Analyzing The Los Angeles Angels 2020 Lineup

Player | Order Number | OPS | OPS+ | DPPA
:---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---:
Mike Trout | 3 | 0.993 | 168 | 0.674
Anthony Rendon | 4 | 0.915 | 151 | 0.599
Tommy La Stella | 2 | 0.819 | 127 | 0.518
Brian Goodwin | 9 | 0.715 | 92 | 0.512
David Fletcher | 1 | 0.801 | 121 | 0.476
Shohei Ohtani | 5 | 0.675 | 80 | 0.483
Justin Upton | 8 | 0.711 | 93 | 0.482
Jason Castro | 7 | 0.668 | 83 | 0.457
Albert Pujols | 6 | 0.665 | 80 | 0.436

## Analyzing the Original Order

1. David Fletcher
2. Tommy La Stella
3. Mike Trout
4. Anthony Rendon
5. Shohei Ohtani
6. Albert Pujols
7. Jason Castro
8. Justin Upton
9. Brian Goodwin

The Angles most common lineup follows the very traditional school of thought for creating orders. They have their best hitter (Trout) hitting 3rd, their 2nd best hitter (Rendon) hitting 4th, and their 3rd best hitter (La Stella) hitting second. Also, their leadoff hitter (Fletcher) is a very typical singles hitter. Finally, their last hitter (Goodwin) isn't their worst hitter, rather a better hitter who can "turn over the order" and get the momentum going for the top of the order. If the Angles had stacked the order via DPPA, they would have runners in scoring position more often as well as have a better chance of scoring those runners.

## David Fletcher

The Angels most-used leadoff hitter this year was David Fletcher. FLetcher is a classic looking leadoff hitter. He takes pitches, doesn't walk or strike out much, and hits a lot of singles. Fletcher hit 50 singles this year but only managed to steal 2 bases, being caught stealing once. Fletcher is not a player that can make it into scoring position (at least to second base) on his own easily or often. Because of that, DPPA suggests that the Angels wasted a handful of at-bats over the shortened season that could have otherwise gone to Mike Trout instead. If the Angels had stacked their order via DPPA, Fletcher would be a much more useful hitter. Hitting singles can be great situationally, like when you have runners in scoring position. Having Fletcher hitting 5th behind hitters who can get themselves into scoring position is advantageous for Fletcher and the Angles, as he can use his fantastic contact to score runners with the singles he tends to hit. 

## Mike Trout

To no one's surprise, Mike Trout does the most DPPA on the Angles squad. He accomplishes this by hitting for a high average with lots of extra-base hits accompanied by lots of walks. With only one stolen base this season, Mike Trouts DPPA is lower than his 2019 DPPA, 0.754, where he stole 11 bases and was only caught stealing twice. It isn't fair to compare 2019 to 2020, as in 2019 Trout played in 134 games versus 53 in 2020. I make the comparison with the intent of illustrating the impact stealing bases can have, alongside plenty of other factors.


## Brian Goodwin

While Goodwin only played 30 games with the Angels before moving to Cincinnati to play 20 games for the Reds, I used his whole season statistics for the sake of this analysis. While he was an Angel, he was most often seen in the 9-hole. Goodwin's offensive production was wasted in the 9-hole, as he did the 4th most DPPA in the lineup, even though his OPS+ is well below average (100). He accomplished this by hitting for extra bases, walking, and stealing bases. Goodwin always had a good chance to not only get on but to get into a dangerous position: scoring position.
