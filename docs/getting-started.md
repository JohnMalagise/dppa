## How to Win a Championship

 In its most simple form, you need to do more damage offensively than you allow defensively.
In theory, how do you win a championship in baseball? To win a championship, you need to win as many games as possible. To win as many games as possible, you need to use your players as efficiently as possible. What does that mean? Speaking specifically offensively, you need to use the your players who do the most damage the most often.

## Creating a lineup

 In creating the best lineup for your team to score the most runs, there are a vast array of statistics that coaches account for in making their lineup. Some of these include batting average, on base percentage, strikeout percentage, on base plus slugging, and many more. Coaches will look at many different statistics, choose who they think are their best 9 hitters, and throw them into their lineup. They are often ordered in the lineup in order to “do a job”. For example, traditionally the first batters job is to get on base any way he can. The second hitters job is to move him over to second at any cost. It is then the 3rd and 4th batters job to score him. The third hitter is historically the best hitter on the team, and the 4th hitter is the “power” hitter. In a perfect world, the idea is that your 1st, 2nd, and 3rd hitter all get on base and your 4th hitter gets to hit a grand slam and score 4 runs! In practice, this never happens. It is an old school way of creating a lineup that leaves potential to score more runs more efficiently. To win the most games and score the most runs, you need to give your hitters who do the most damage the most at bats per game per season.

## What is damage?

So what is damage? Damage is advancing a base in any way. That could be hitting a single, getting walked, hitting a home run, or stealing a base. 

## Creating a Lineup With DPPA 

To win the most games, you want to give you hitters who do the most damage per plate appearance the most at bats. This disregards the old school methods of making batting lineups, throwing out the “jobs” or “roles”. Why do you want your lead off hitter to just get on to first? Why not have a start the game with a batter who can hit a home run, or hit a double and steal third? A runner on first does not equate to a lot of damage according to the estimated runs saved, or “ERS”. 

## Why Does Batting Order Matter 

According to this [article] (https://fantasy.fangraphs.com/buying-generic-plate-appearances-by-lineup-spot/), for every 600 plate appearances the first hitter in the lineup gets, the second hitter only gets roughly 586. Comparing the first hitter to the 4th hitter, the 4th hitter gets only 557 plate appearances. By not putting the hitters who do the most damage at the top of the order, you are subsequently wasting at bats as well as runs over the course of a season. 

## Creating a More Efficient Batting Order

So how should you stack your batting order? OPS or OPS+ is a great place to start. You will be much more successful in scoring runs over the course of a season if you stack your order from highest OPS to lowest OPS, but OPS isn’t perfect for this application. OPS ignores stolen bases, and is calculated off of at bats rather than plate appearances. What is the difference between hitting a double and walking then stealing second? Answer: not much. OPS rewards hitters who hit for extra bases, but ignores the damages done by stealing bases. 

## What is DPPA

In order to create a statistic to help make the most efficient run scoring lineup, you need to take into account all damages done by a player. DPPA, or Damage Per Plate Appearance accurately takes into account all ways that a player can do offensive damage. It takes into account hits, extra base hits, walks, hit by pitch, intentional walks, and stolen bases. The only thing that is not taken into account for DPPA is ROE (reached on error). Because DPPA takes into account stolen bases, it also must properly weigh in caught stealing as well. The equation ends up being ```singles + doubles(2) + triples(3) + home runs(4) + walks + hit by pitch + intentional walks + stolen bases / plate appearances + caught stealing``` I believe that DPPA is the most efficient tool in creating the most damaging batting order.
